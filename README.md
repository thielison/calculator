# JavaScript Calculator

This project is a user-friendly on-screen calculator that has been built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The calculator is designed to provide basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and supports input from both the keyboard and mouse.

## Technologies Used

-   JavaScript
-   HTML
-   CSS

The calculator has been built with a simple and intuitive interface that closely resembles a basic handheld calculator. It includes a display for user input, digit buttons, operator buttons, a decimal point button, a clear button, an equals button, and a backspace button.

To enhance the user experience, several features have been implemented. The calculator limits the user to only one decimal point, rounds answers with long decimals to prevent them from overflowing the screen, and displays a friendly error message if the user tries to divide by 0. Moreover, the clear button wipes out any existing data to allow for easy recalculations.

This project was created as part of the JavaScript curriculum on The Odin Project, a comprehensive web development curriculum designed to teach individuals the skills they need to become proficient web developers.
